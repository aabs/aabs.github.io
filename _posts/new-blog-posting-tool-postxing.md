Here is a nice thing. A blog posting tool called PostXING.

Alledgedly it has source code formatting built into it. Lets give it a  
try.

      public void OnChooseSomething() 
      { 
        IsChosen = true; 
        if(ChooseThingClicked != null) 
          ChooseThingClicked(this, null); 
      }

Sweet. It has [CodeHTMLer](http://puzzleware.net/codehtmler/default.aspx) built in.  
You just hit the syntax highlight button and away it goes:
