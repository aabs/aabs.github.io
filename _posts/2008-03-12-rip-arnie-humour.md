My blogging has been pretty sporadic of late. My evenings have been spent working on a long SPARQL tutorial for IBM. It's just going through the last editorial reviews now (with the good folks at [Backstop Media](http://www.backstopmedia.com/)) and should be published in a day or two.

Bob and Troy at Backstop are great editors, and their suggestions have kept the tutorial focused and much easier to understand. But I just had to find somewhere to put this snippet that they've asked me to cut. I know it's unrelated to the tutorial, but it made me laugh.

Let this be the last resting place of my daft attempts to make SPARQL funny.
