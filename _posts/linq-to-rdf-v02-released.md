Thanks to the good work of the WIX team, in preparing a version of WIX 3 that works perfectly on Visual Studio .NET 2008 beta 2, I have been able to prepare the latest release version of LinqToRdf for download. This version has been (partially) tested using a remote triple store based on Joseki and Jena, and seems to work fine. I intend over the coming months to put together some more comprehensive documentation on getting LinqToRdf up and running with a Jena triple store hosted in SQL server.  
Till then, you will just have to make do with the raw speed of SemWeb :-).

You can get the latest version of LinqToRdf here: [LinqToRdf-0.2.msi](http://linqtordf.googlecode.com/files/LinqToRdf-0.2.msi)
