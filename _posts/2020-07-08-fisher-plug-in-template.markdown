title: A fisher plugin github repo template
---

Fishdots has grown to the size that it's taking up too much space, and takes too long during startup.  So, I've started work on a rewrite, based on the standard approach for autoloading and the approach recommended by the fisher plugin manager. That means a whole bunch of new repos, and probably a lot of refactoring of fishdots. 

I've created a [Fisher plugin template](https://github.com/aabs/fisher-plugin) to use as the basis for each of the plugins I rewrite.

I will be using this a lot. Feel free to do the same.
