I design and develop complex data driven systems in a variety of modern technology stacks. With over 20 years spent leading development and design teams, my hands-on expertise means I can cut through the complexity to find designs that are simple, maintainable and easy to operate. I nurture development teams helping them to raise the maturity of their engineering practices.
