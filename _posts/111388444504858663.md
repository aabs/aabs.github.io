There are real boundaries to thought, that are genetically endowed in people. People who formulate new ideas may be either finding something that was always possible to think in all of us, or they may be ***mutants***! They may even be ***aliens*** trying to subvert our culture. We should therefore subject all innovators in all areas to an inquisition to make sure that they are one of us.
